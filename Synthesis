The standard expectation for employees is an 8-hour workday, inclusive of a 2-hour break, resulting in an expected minimum of 6 hours of active work daily. However, an analysis of the workforce reveals that less than 10% of employees meet this expected commitment on average.

Potential Implications:
This shortfall in meeting the expected work commitment may have significant repercussions on organizational output and employee well-being. Some potential adverse effects include:

Reduced Productivity:
Employees not meeting the 6-hour daily commitment may experience lower productivity levels, impacting overall organizational output.

Inefficient Resource Utilization:
The organization might be underutilizing its workforce resources, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.

Work-Life Imbalance:
Employees struggling to meet the commitment may experience heightened stress levels and a compromised work-life balance.

Impact on Team Collaboration:
Inconsistencies in work commitment may disrupt team dynamics, collaboration, and the achievement of collective goals.

Employee Morale and Satisfaction:
Persistent challenges in meeting the expected commitment can negatively influence employee morale and job satisfaction.

Segmented analysis would be carried out on lower commiting employees to further understand their work patterns and gain deeper understanding into the issue, However steps such as Communication/Awareness,Training/Support Programs,Incentive packages could potentially help to mitigate these challenges and optimize organizational performance
